### Key Learning Moments

**The State Management Breakthrough:**
When I first encountered the challenge of managing cart state across multiple components, I initially tried prop drilling. This quickly became unmanageable, leading me to discover React Context API. The moment I implemented CartContext and saw how clean and efficient state management could be was a turning point in my React understanding.

**The Responsive Design Challenge:**
Building for mobile-first was initially counterintuitive - I was used to desktop-first thinking. Through this project, I learned that mobile-first isn't just about screen sizes, but about progressive enhancement and touch-friendly interactions.

**The Performance Optimization Journey:**
Discovering that large product images were slowing down the application led me down a rabbit hole of image optimization, lazy loading, and performance best practices. This experience taught me that user experience isn't just about functionality, but also about speed and efficiency.
